                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>After completing a Computer Science Diploma my main point of focus became Web and App Development. Sooner i came to learn that there are front-end and back-end developers and i became comfortable with the idea of doing both as as Full-Stack
                    Web Developer. Hopefully, in time, i will sharpen my skills enough to be a competent full-stack web developer and be able to deliver a quality service to those in need.

                <p>My first offical job is with the Ministry of Health, Guyana. I started with the title of System Support Officer which in simpler terms is a Computer Technician. This is where is would come to learn the in's and out's of a computer system
                    to be comfortable enough to carefully observe and assess the various components to determine what is or may be wrong and to apply the most effective solution to fix the issue/s, if any.

                <p>All my life, for as long as i can remember I've found my self to be always listening to music to relax, work even to exercise and it never once occured to me that i could make music myself that is unitil i met a friend that showed me how
                    to do so. Ever since then I've dipped my toes into being a music producer (a mediocore one at the moment) and maybe one day I can perform one of my songs on a big stage. :)

            <p>
                Hi, my name Dennis Bagot. I am System Support Officer currently employed at the Ministry of Health. After some time passed a heavy interest in software development grew within me and I started to get involed with a project that was on-going at the ministry.
                The project was the development of the Guyana Health Information System (G.H.I.S) and that's where i started learning what it takes to be a developer. But after making some observations of the ICT sector within our country, it was clear
                to me that Developers weren't really needed so I've decided to advance my studies by completing the comTIA IT Certification Courses to change my career path to be a Networking and Cyber Security professional to be able to enforce and protect
                networks and servers across the country.
            </p>
            <p>As a side note I've grown fond of sound design and music production and I would make different types of beats as a fun hobby of mine. :)</p>
